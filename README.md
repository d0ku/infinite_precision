## Infinite Precision

### Have you ever wondered whether it's possible to just add 1/3 and 2/3 so you'll get 1?

## Now you can!

```Python
import inf_prec

a = inf_prec.Number(1, 3)
b = inf_prec.Number(2, 3)

c = a + b
```

Basic definition of a fraction (numerator and denominator) and some arithmetic operations implemented.

It is meant to be project for laughs, so don't run it on production or something.
